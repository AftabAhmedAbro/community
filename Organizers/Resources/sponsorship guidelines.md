# Docker Meetup Sponsorship Guidelines

## Why sponsor? 

The main benefit of sponsoring a Docker Meetup is visibility. As a sponsor, you can gain visibility in the following ways:
- Listing as a sponsor on the meetup.com page left column
- Listing in the meetup event page event details
- Thanks in pre- and/or post-event emails 
- Verbal thank you in opening or closing remarks 
- Recognition in the following Docker promotional channels 
- Docker social media networks 
- Docker Weekly newsletter
- Docker Monthly Events blog
		
There are three sponsorship options available:
- Venue Host sponsorship
- Food/ Beverage sponsorship
- Venue + Food/ Beverage sponsorship

Thank you to all our wonderful sponsors! 

##General Sponsorship FAQ

###Can we present a talk at the event we sponsor?
Yes as long as the talk is not a sales pitch. Another option is a 2-5 minute intro at the beginning of the event. 

###Do you offer annual sponsorship packages? 
In an effort to keep our meetup events neutral, we mostly welcome ad hoc sponsorships. If you are interested in a recurring sponsorship, please contact Docker at meetups@docker.com 
						
###What is the agenda for a typical meetup?
A typical meetup involves a few speaker presentations and some time for Q&A. Speaker presentations usually vary from one to three presenters who typically speak from 30 minutes to one hour. Events usually start in the evening around 6-7PM. Your local organizer contact will be able to give you the full details for their city. 


## Venue Host FAQ

###How many guests will be invited? 
The entire meetup group will be invited but the actual rsvp number is up to the capacity of your venue. 

###As a venue host, what do I need to provide?				
As the venue host, you will provide the event space, Wi-Fi and A/V equipment (microphone and projection capabilities). Please confirm with your local organizer contact. 

###Do I need to sponsor food and beverages?
While we often secure a separate sponsor for food and beverages, many venues are also able to provide food and beverages for the event. A typical meal is pizza and a selection of soft drinks and beer, but other meal options are definitely well-received by the attendees.
