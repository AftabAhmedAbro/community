## FAQ
### What infrastructure are we using for the workshop?
To run this workshop, you’ll use Play With Docker.  Check out the workshop here: http://www.docker.com/labs

### Can I share the link to the lab online before the in-person event? 
Please don't share out the link to the Play with Docker playground except during the workshop. We want to encourage as many people as possible to come to your meetups in person. :) For this reason, it may not work between workshops.

### How do I request instances for my workshop?
ALSO NOTE: YOU MUST request instances before your workshop. We need two working days notice. Please email mike.coleman@docker.com at least two working days before your event with:
The location of your meetup (the city name is fine)
The number of participants
Date of your workshop

### How many people attendees should we aim to have at the event? 
This is up to you! Remember, take into account how many mentors will be able to attend. Attendees are going to need help while they work through the workshop. We recommend one mentor to every five to 10 attendees. 

### How familiar do attendees have to be with Docker to complete the workshops?
Attendees should have an understanding of what Docker is and how containers work. The orchestration workshop is considered intermediate level. Docker advanced and expert level users are strongly encouraged to attend and help as mentors to help those working through the labs and courses. 

### What is the ideal mentor-mentee pairing?
We are working on and need your help recruiting as many mentors as possible for each group that will host an event. If you can, try to have at least one mentor per 5-10 attendees. However, the more the merrier! 

### How long should the event last? Is there an agenda? 
We suggest that the event runs at least 3 hours to allow attendees to fully complete the workshop. 

### Can we partner up with other local groups and/ or companies to use their resources?
Absolutely! We encourage you to partner with other relevant local groups. This is a great way to bring new members to your group and potentially solicit new sponsors. 

### What kind of groups should we reach out to?
Local tech-related groups are a good bet! These can include IT pros user groups (VMUGs, DevOps, SREs) and those targeting underrepresented groups (like Women Who Code). Karen and Lisa can help connect you with other local groups.

### Can Docker sponsor food/beverage and or venue costs?
We do have a limited budget allocated for hosting this workshop, but we want to prioritize collaborating with local partners. Karen (karen@docker.com) is available to help find food, beverage and venue sponsors if you need some assistance. 

### When will we know who the mentors / partners are that we can work with?
It is your responsibility to recruit mentors. If there is a Docker partner, employee or Captain in your area, we will connect you! If there are none in your area, and you are having trouble recruiting mentors, reach out to us, we can try to help. 

### How can we advertise our workshop? 
If your event is open to the public, there are a few ways you can promote and organize your event. The first way is to connect with a local docker chapter. See the list here. We can make connections to the local community leaders who can help promote. 

If your event is internal to your company, we suggest using whatever method your company uses to organize events for your team. Often times your manager or your office ops team would have some good ideas on how to promote this to your company. 

### What copy should I use for the event pages?

#### Event Title: 
Docker Workshop: Orchestration for IT Pros!  

#### Event Copy: 
Join us for a Docker Workshop! 

This workshop is your opportunity to learn how enterprises can manage a diverse set of applications that includes both traditional applications and microservices, built on Linux and Windows, and intended for x86 servers, mainframes, and public clouds. Docker mentors will be on hand at this event to help you as you work through the self paced materials. 

In this hands-on workshop, we'll build a multi-os Docker Cluster  and then use features like constraints and affinities to place Windows, Linux, and hybrid workloads appropriately. All attendees will be provided a set of cloud instances on which to work, all you need to bring is a laptop with an SSH client.

Are you an advanced user? We strongly encourage Docker users of all skill levels to attend! We need a network of mentors who understand the Docker platform to answer any questions that attendees working through the workshop may have. Want to mentor? Email me at: xxxx

Agenda:
4:45 - Doors Open
5:00 - Welcome message, presentation of Docker & snacks
5:30 - 8:00 - Working session

As we get closer to the event, we will share more information including materials on how to prepare for this lab.
