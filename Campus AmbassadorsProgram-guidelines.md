# Docker Campus Ambassadors Program Guidelines!

Many students from universities and colleges all over the world reach out to us daily because they want to learn Docker or help others learn Docker. So we decided to support Campus Ambassadors at different colleges / universities to bring together students who are interested in, use, develop, and support the Docker ecosystem. Whether you just want to see what the Campus Ambassador program entails or you already have experience organizing events and are eager to bring Docker to your campus, these guidelines should help you decide whether you should apply to the program. Applicants should already have an intermediate prior knowledge of Docker and the ambition to become advanced users.

If you decide to apply for a Campus Ambassador leadership position, you will be participating in this program and shall agree to abide by the following program guidelines. This is to ensure that Docker Campus Ambassadors are a respected and professional group of students demonstrating a positive impact in the Docker ecosystem.
This document is not a comprehensive list of dos and donâ€™ts, but rather a living set of guidelines to follow that we will continue to refine as the program matures. Our goal is to raise awareness of the potential for actions that could negatively impact members of the community, not restrict the diversity of ideas and expression.
You are responsible for keeping abreast of changes to this document. If you need further clarification or are unable to fulfill any of the following guidelines, please let us know at your earliest convenience.

# Embody the Docker Community Code of Conduct

All Docker community members should strive to follow our community Code of Conduct. As a Docker Campus Ambassador, it is especially important to lead by showing model behavior at all times, both in person and online.

# Understand Docker beyond containers.

In being a Campus Ambassador, you understand that Docker is an evolving platform stack. Ideally, you have a good understanding of all the pieces (Engine, Swarm, Machine, Compose, etc.) and how they fit together. You may feature Docker ecosystem tools at the events your organize but you are still enthusiastic about Docker as a whole technology and platform.

# Be a force for good in the community

- Promote and support inclusivity, respect, and professionalism in the tech community.
- Ensure that all participants can freely and openly share ideas in a safe and welcoming environment that encourages mutual respect and collaboration.
- Strive to keep the group active with frequent events and presentations (at least one every semester) on relevant content (including the latest Docker releases and cool projects using Docker products). If you are struggling with any aspect of organizing an event please give us a heads up so that we can help out.
- Keep up-to-date on the latest technological advances in Docker and the ecosystem.
- Collaborate with the Docker Community team to support the organization of local editions of global meetup campaigns (Docker Birthday, Global Mentor Week, etc) at your university.

# Curate balanced and accurate content

- The Docker Community team will provide you with much of the content you need, including slide decks, training labs, information about new product releases tec but you are also welcome to accept talks from other members of the community.
- When selecting content for you events and/or using program resources to produce content, prioritize featuring Docker-native solutions over others.
- Be respectful when mentioning other vendors, technologies, and communities in the ecosystem.
- Select content that is educational, accurate, and free from sales pitches.
- Do not accept talks which slander or publish libel against Docker or other people and companies.
- Be rigorous in assessing the content submitted by potential speakers. If you need help validating results and analyses, reach out to us for assistance.
- When selecting events to promote, be sure the event features Docker-native solutions in a capacity and highlight that information in the body of the message.
- If you experience difficulties with Docker products or programs, give us the opportunity to address your feedback in advance.
- Make sure you're subscribed to the Docker Campus Ambassadors mailing list on Mobilize to stay informed about the latest Docker News and community activities

# Enforcing these Community Guidelines
 
Docker reserves the right to remove any member from the Campus Ambassadors program for violating these guidelines. In the event of a violation, the Docker community team will review the situation and determine the consequences on a case by case basis. When a Campus Ambassador is removed from the program, we retire the remaining benefits and his or her access to Docker Campus Ambassadors resources.
